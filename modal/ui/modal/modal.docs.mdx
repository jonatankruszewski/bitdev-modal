## React Component for rendering an empty modal

A modal that shows in the screen.
Functionalities:

- Closes on X, as well on click outside if set `clickAway=true`
- Toggle the element by passing a boolean to `show`. This boolean value would probably be attached to a piece of state of the parent of this modal.
- Pass a boolean to `backDrop` to switch between a faded background or a soft shadow.

### Component usage

- Pass a react JSX element to render inside of it

```js
<Modal show={true} backDrop={false} clickAway={true}>
  <h1>Hello I am a child!</h1>
</Modal>
```
