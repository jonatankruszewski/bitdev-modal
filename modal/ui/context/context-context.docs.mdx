## React Modal Context

State management for the ui/modal component.

This is a simple context to avoid drilling down properties to the ui/modal component or to consume its state and functions on childs that were rendered through props.children.

### Component usage

```tsx live
<div>
  <ContextProvider>
    <ContextContext.Consumer>
      {({ isOpen }) => (
        <div>Current isOpen Value: {JSON.stringify(isOpen)}</div>
      )}
    </ContextContext.Consumer>
  </ContextProvider>
</div>
```

```tsx live
<BasicThemeUsage />
```
